#### Transformations

* **City**, **State**, and **Postal Code** are seperated out from a single text field.
* All charters without data for **Virtual** are assumed to be *Site Based*.
* **Public Funding** is the total of this column where the *School IRN matches that of the charter*.
* **% Spent in Classroom** is computed in the following manner:


	1. total expenses are computed by totaling columns 4 through 9
	2. classroom expenditure is computed by subtracting column 8 (administrative) from total expenses
	3. classroom percentage is then computed by dividing classroom expenditure by total expenses
	4. classroom percentage is then rounded to three significant digits
